# Building Speech Analyzer
This document details the build process for Speech Analyzer.
The source code for Speech Analyzer is stored on GitHub. https://github.com/.
Speech Analyzer is a 32-bit application.  Use (x86) installers where appropriate.

# Software Requirements
Building Speech Analyzer requires the following software to be installed:
1. Speech Analyzer.
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
1. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015.
1. InnoSetup 5.5.3 'unicode'.  You will need to install both isetup-5.5.3-unicode.exe and ispack-5.5.3-unicode.exe.  Innosetup is found at http://files.jrsoftware.org/is/5/.  Accept all defaults when installing the application(s).
1. Xerces DLL.  The xerces-c_3_1.dll is located in *SpeechAnalyzer\DistFiles\Xerces*.

# Prerequisites
1. Speech Analyzer.  Install Speech Analyzer to create application directories and install application dependencies that are needed by Speech Analyzer.  Data samples will also be installed.
1. Visual C++ Redistributable.
The installation file *vc_redist.24212.x86.exe* is stored in the project subdirectory : *SpeechAnalyzer\DistFiles\Microsoft\vc2015*.  To install it, right click on the executable and select *Run as Adminstrator*.

# Build Procedure
To build Speech Analyzer, do the following:
1. Obtain the source code from GitHub.  The checkout will take a while. Note: Src/xerces-c is a submodule so you'll need to clone with:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sillsdev/SpeechAnalyzer
```
1. Open Visual Studio 2015 and select and open the solution file : *SpeechAnalyzer\SpeechAnalyzer.sln.*
1. On the menu bar, select the *Debug* or *Release* configuration.  If you want to build a installer executable later on, you will need to select the *Release* configuration.
1. In the solution explorer, right click on the *SA* project and select the *Set as Startup Project* menu item.
1. Use *Ctrl-Alt-F7* or select *Build/Rebuild Solution* from the menu to build the project.
1. Wait for the build to complete.  You will see the following in the *Build Output* window then the project is done compiling:  *Rebuild All: 15 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped*
1. Depending on the build configuration you selected, *Debug* or *Release*, Visual Studio will create either a *Debug* or *Release* directory at the root of the project. (e.g. SpeechAnalyzer/Debug*).
1. Copy the Xerces DLL into the *Debug* or *Release* directory.  You will only need to do this once.
1. Start SpeechAnalyzer by right-clicking on the *SA* project and selecting *Debug/Start new instance*.

# Installer Creation
1. Double click on the *SpeechAnalyzer\Install\SpeechAnalyzer.iss* to open it with InnoSetup/Studio.
1. In InnoSetup, select *Project\Compile* or use *Ctrl-F9*.
1. After the compile is completed, the installer executable will be stored in the *SpeechAnalyzer/Install/Output* subdirectory.  DO NOT commit this directory when commiting the branch.

# Updating version tags
1. In prepartion for a new release, the following version labels need to be update.
- Install\SpeechAnalyzer.iss : change the *MyAppVersion* tag
- Src\Lang\SA_ENU.RC : change both instances in FILEVERSION
- Src\SA.rc : change both instances in FILEVERSION
- Src\SA\Sa_Doc.cpp : change Lift reference.
- Src\Lang\SA_DEU.rc : change both instances in FILEVERSION
